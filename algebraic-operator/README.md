# Algebraic Operator

Observation: Most operators don't do anything particularly interesting. They map from a CR to a bunch of K8s Resources.

This operator adds Composable Algebraic Data Type to the Kubernetes API. 

Enables Custom Resources to map directly to other Kubernetes resources without writing a custom operator.

Takes a Composition CR to define the mapping between origin and derived Resources.

Composition CR defines CRD for resource automatically.
