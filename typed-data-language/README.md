# Typed Data Language

## About

Typed Data language is a definition for a data representation language that supports algebraic datatypes 
and Type initialisation without any logic. It enables type composition without resorting to text templating as
commonly found in YAML, JSON or XML based data definition languages.

## Principles

1. Composability – Types defined in the language should be arbitrarily composable in a safe manner.
2. YAML Compatibility – For the sake of adoption and ease of use
3. Shema-based – That is, with a native mechanism for verifying teh correctness of a type definition or instantiation. ie: verifiable
